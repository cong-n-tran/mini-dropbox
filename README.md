```

### WebSocket Events

Connect to `/socket.io` with JWT token for real-time synchronization:

#### Client Events
- `connect` - Connect to sync channel
- `join_sync_room` - Join user's sync room
- `leave_sync_room` - Leave sync room
- `request_sync` - Request sync events

#### Server Events
- `connected` - Connection confirmation
- `file_uploaded` - File upload notification
- `file_deleted` - File deletion notification
- `sync_event` - General sync event
- `sync_events` - Batch sync events

## Architecture

### Storage Distribution

Files are stored using a hash-based distribution system:
- SHA256 hash calculated for each file
- First 4 characters create directory structure (aa/bb/)
- Deduplication based on file hash
- Unique filename generation to avoid collisions

### Database Schema

- **users**: User accounts and storage quotas
- **devices**: User devices for sync tracking
- **files**: File metadata and current versions
- **file_versions**: Historical file versions
- **file_shares**: File sharing configurations
- **sync_events**: Synchronization event log

### Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- bcrypt password hashing
- File access control and validation
- Storage quota enforcement
- CORS protection
- File type restrictions

## Configuration

Key environment variables:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: JWT signing key
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `STORAGE_PATH`: File storage directory
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: Maximum file size (bytes)
- `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`: Comma-separated file extensions

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

1. Set environment variables for production
2. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mini_dropbox
   ```

3. Use gunicorn for production server:
   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 run:app
   ```

4. Set up reverse proxy (nginx) for static files and SSL
5. Configure backup strategy for database and storage

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "run:app"]
```

# mini-dropbox - cse 5406-004 project assignment 2

A Mini Dropbox-like Distributed File Storage System that allows users to securely upload, store, sync, and access files across multiple devices. The system will distribute files across storage nodes, manage metadata centrally, and ensure redundancy for reliability.

### Five Functional Requirements

#### User Authentication & Authorization
- Users can create accounts, log in, and receive session tokens.
- Only authenticated users can upload, download, or manage files.

#### File Upload & Storage Distribution
- Files are uploaded via a client API and split or assigned to storage nodes.
- Support for multiple storage nodes for redundancy or sharding.

#### File Retrieval & Download
- Users can browse their files and download them from distributed storage nodes.

#### Metadata Management & Versioning
- System keeps track of filenames, paths, versions, sizes, and modification timestamps.
- Users can access the latest version or rollback to a previous version.

#### File Synchronization & Update Notification
- Detect changes in files and notify clients when a file has been updated.
- Basic sync mechanism to keep client files up to date.
